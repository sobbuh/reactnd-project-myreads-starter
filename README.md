MyReads is a bookshelf app, which allows users to search for books and add them to their bookshelf, categorizing them as "read", "want to read", or "currently reading". 

```
git clone https://github.com/sobbuh/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
